**Fig.1**: **Augment vascular disease diagnosis.** We present the docters with explainable images, including both vascular structures and multi-dimensional features under different modalities, instead of treating deep learning as a "black box" for 0 or 1 diagnosis.

**Fig.2**: **The augmentation principle of vascular disease diagnosis.** VasNet learns the image-to-image mapping between two unpaired image domains: raw vascular observations corrupted by scattering, aberrations or non-uniform noises and the segmentation of retinal vascular images. It extracts the vascular topology, colour-codes the blood flow dynamics and unveils the spatiotemporal illumination of regions of interest, examines the pathological features and presents suspicions in contrasting colours, and discovers new diagnostic features and suggests the probability of a disease occurrence.


## Pytorch implementation
* Download the trained model and the demo videos from [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/VasNet-SI/11986962)  or [Baiduyun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JckTg8kLgCgrkJM0_XxtMA) (PIN: bj3y) 

* File structure
    - `./input` includes the training data (trainA & trainB) and the demo data (testB), where the domain B is defined as scattering modality. If you want to test your own image, please notice the image size and put it in the folder `./input/testB`. (Note, the testA is not needed, and the vessel color should be **brighter** than the background (you may need to inverse the gray input if neccessary)!)
    - `./model` includes the model files for testing
        * Download the trained model 00163.pth file, and place in this subfolder.
    - `./output_test/train` the test/train output will save to this folder 

* Install the environment
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`  # Python 3
    - Copy the `./model/vgg*` files to the path `~/.torch/models/`
    - My hardware is Titan Xp with CUDA10.1.

* To train: `bash qsub_train.sh`
* To test: `bash qsub_test.sh`
